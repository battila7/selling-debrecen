You are designing and implementing the frontend for a LUXURY "old-money" STYLE REAL ESTATE WEBSITE.

Follow these rules EXACTLY for ALL UI, layout, and styling work.

## Overall aesthetic

- Aim for: understated, timeless, old-money / quiet-luxury vibe suitable for a high-end real estate agent.
- Visual keywords: elegant, heritage, classic, calm, trustworthy, minimal but warm.
- Let property photography be the "loud" element; the UI chrome should be subtle and reserved.

## Color palette (ABSOLUTELY NO GREENS)

Use a **restricted palette** based on warm neutrals, navy, and optional burgundy. Do not invent new colors unless they clearly fit into these families.

**Base / backgrounds**
- Primary page background: soft warm off-white  
  - Example: `#F3EFE8` or `#FAF4E9`
- Secondary panel/card backgrounds (search boxes, listing cards, content sections): warm stone / taupe  
  - Example: `#BBA591` or a slightly lighter/desaturated variant

**Accents**
- Primary accent color (buttons, main CTAs, important highlights): deep heritage navy  
  - Example: `#0E1C4F`
- Secondary accent (used sparingly for emphasis, tags, or section headers): rich burgundy / wine  
  - Example: `#6E1E2A` or `#7F1F3D`
- Optional subtle gold-beige accent for lines, icons, or small details  
  - Example: `#C19A6B`

**Text colors**
- Main body text: very dark charcoal, not pure black  
  - Example: `#1A1A1A` or `#2C2C2C`
- Muted secondary text (meta info, labels): medium warm gray  
  - Example: `#6C6460`
- On dark backgrounds (navy or burgundy sections): use white or slightly off-white for readability.

## Layout & components

- Use generous spacing and white space; layouts should feel airy and calm.
- Prefer simple grids and clear hierarchy over busy decoration.
- Cards:
  - Soft corners (small to medium border-radius, not pill-shaped).
  - Very subtle borders in taupe or light gray, or soft shadow—never harsh black borders.
- Sectioning:
  - Alternate between cream background and very light taupe background sections to create gentle structure.
  - Occasional full-width navy or burgundy strips for “hero”, “about the agent”, or stats sections.

## Typography

- Headings:
  - Use a classic, elegant serif font (see the global css config) for H1–H3.
  - Title case or all caps with slightly increased letter-spacing is encouraged for key headings.
- Body text:
  - Use a clean, neutral sans-serif for paragraphs and labels.
  - Line height should be comfortable and slightly generous to preserve the airy feeling.
- Avoid playful, rounded, or ultra-modern futuristic fonts.

## Real-estate specific guidance

- Hero section:
  - Full-bleed property or city imagery.
  - Overlay text and search controls using navy or slightly translucent navy over the image with white text.
  - Keep overlays minimal and clean—no bright color blocks.

## Do / Don’t summary

- DO: warm neutrals, navy, burgundy, gentle gold-beige accents.
- DO: restrained, editorial look; plenty of space; minimal chrome.
- DO: serif headings + sans-serif body; calm, high-end feeling.

- DO NOT: introduce bright, saturated UI colors.
- DO NOT: use heavy gradients, neon glows, or playful cartoonish elements.

Always prefer the option that feels more heritage, classic, and quiet-luxury, even if it means fewer colors or simpler layouts.
