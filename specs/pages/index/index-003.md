# Index-003: Listing Card Design

## Context

Let's improve the design of the listing card.

## Requirements

- Rounded corners.
- No shadow.
- The image covers the entire card.
- Only the price and the address is shown at the bottom. They sit above the image that covers the card.
- Make sure to apply same black fade to the image so the price and the address are readable.
