# Index 001: Hero Section

## Context

Let's start the index page by creating a hero section.

## Requirements

- Use the `src/images/hero-background.jpg` image as the background of the hero.
- The hero should have the Selling Debrecen title with some random real-estate-related subtitle.
- The hero should be full height (one screen/viewport/whatever).

## Technical stuff

Place the section into its own component in the appropriate directory.
