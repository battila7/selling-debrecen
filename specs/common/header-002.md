# Header 002: Mobile menu

## Context

Let's adjust the mobile menu to look just a little bit better.

## Requirements

- The menu itself should ease-in from the right and fade in simultaneously.
- It should be full width and full height, entirely black.
- It should have a close button in the top-right corner (same place as the open button) using a Lucide X icon.
- The open button should use a Lucide Menu icon and should not change on click (the X icon appears in the overlay instead).
- The menu should be implemented with vanilla JavaScript (not Alpine.js).
- The hamburger and X icons should transition smoothly with rotation and scale animations.
- Body scroll should be prevented when the menu is open.
- The menu should close when clicking on links, clicking outside the menu, pressing Escape, or clicking the close button.
